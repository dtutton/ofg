The first purpose was to take advantage of the leverage offered by more complex trading instruments and strategies to generate capital for specific philanthropic endeavors.  The second was to use these same instruments to generate a return on investment  for those who hold an interest in OFG that many brokers or money managers were unable to produce.</FONT></P>
